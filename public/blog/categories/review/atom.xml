    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>The Pickup</h3>

<p>Last Wednesday I took the trip up to NYC, to the top floor of Chelsea Market to pick up a device that many have waited anxiously for. A device unlike anything else we&rsquo;ve seen before: Google&rsquo;s Glass. This is the Explorer Edition of the device, which is targeted towards developers, who attended Google&rsquo;s IO conference last year. I was fortunate to be invited to pick up my device on the first day of New York&rsquo;s pickups, which followed several pickup days in Mountain View the previous week.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2013/04/29/s_9e3e2acb-a746-4606-a034-1df2c8e2a3cc-0.jpeg" width="500" height="500" title="The View #throughglass" ></p>

<p>The pickup experience was very exciting, it included an informative one-on-one experience with a Glass Guide, who helped walk me through the device (which I had gotten some previous experience <a href="http://michaelevans.org/blog/2013/02/20/googles-project-glass/">a few months back</a>) and fit it to my face. The top floor of Chelsea Market allowed me to break in the camera of the device with a nice view of lower Manhattan.</p>

<p>I was able to try on all five colors that were available, but I ended up choosing charcoal (also known as black.) Other options included Cotton, Shale, Tangerine, and Sky (white, grey, orange and light blue, respectively.)</p>

<p>Configuring Glass was a snap, I opted to use the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.glass.companion">MyGlass app</a> for Android, although users without the app, can use a web based utility to set up their device. After my scheduled pickup apoinment, another Explorer and myself walked up towards Times Square, and were greeted with several people giving us a look for wearing at our new eyeware.</p>

<p>So far people have either thought they look ridiculous, which might be the nature of the device, or the fact that I&rsquo;ve been wearing them overtop of my prescription glasses. This hasn&rsquo;t stopped anyone, however, from asking me to try them on and get a demo of the features.</p>

<h3>What&rsquo;s in the box?</h3>

<p>Included in the box is Glass (obviously), a micro USB cable and a AC adapter for it, a microfiber bag for storing Glass when it&rsquo;s not in use, and two visor attachments, one polarized for sun, and the other clear.</p>

<h3>Thoughts so far</h3>

<p>Since I&rsquo;ve only had the device for a few days, I&rsquo;ll need to post a review after I&rsquo;ve used it for a little longer. So far I&rsquo;ve enjoyed the hands-free navigation for wandering around DC, as well as taking some snapshots. I&rsquo;ve always thought it was a little awkward to reply to text messages and emails using your voice (which is why I never really did it on my phone), but maybe I&rsquo;ll warm up to it with Glass. The battery life has been pretty decent, even with the heavy usage of showing it off to excited friends.</p>

<h3>But wait&hellip;there&rsquo;s more!</h3>

<p>A few days after I returned with Glass, I was interviewed by The Fold, a flagship video series by The Washington Post! You can check out the video here:</p>

    <updated>2012-09-07T20:11:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://michaelevans.org/blog/2012/09/07/nexus-q-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s a <em>what</em>? Ever since I returned from Google I/O, this is what people have been saying when they see the newest addition to my TV setup, the Nexus Q. It’s hard to blame them though, since it just looks so different, for a home theatre device. unlike those bland, black boxes that most living rooms are filled with, the Nexus Q is a heavy (about two pounds) sphere, which is lit by a ring of 32 LEDs. The top side of the Q spins freely to function as a volume knob, and can be tapped to mute.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2012/09/07/q.jpeg" width="400" height="400" title="Nexus Q" ></p>

<p>On the back of the Q, things are less clean. There’s both micro HDMI and optical audio out, ethernet and a micro USB port for “encouraged hacking”. There’s also a set of banana connectors to allow you to hook up speakers to the built in 25-watt amplifier.</p>

<p>So how’s the UI of the Nexus Q, you might ask. Does it look as smooth as Jelly Bean does on the other devices that I <a href="/blog/2012/07/03/nexus-7-review/">showed you a few weeks ago</a>? Funny thing is, the Nexus Q doesn’t have a UI of it’s own; it requires an Android device to set up. All you need to do is tap an NFC enabled device to the sphere, and it will take you to download the Nexus Q app from Google Play. Start up the app, log in with your Google account, and you’re all set to use the Q.</p>

<p>Since the Q doesn’t have it’s own UI, let’s take a look at the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.setupwarlock">Nexus Q app for Android</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2012/09/07/qapp.jpeg" width="400" height="400" title="Nexus Q App" ></p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t really use the app for anything after setting up the Q initially, all the media is controlled through the Play Music, Play Movies and Youtube apps. All you need to do is hit the little triangle that will appear when you&rsquo;re on the same network as a Q.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2012/09/07/music.png" width="400" height="400" title="Play Music with Q" ></p>

<p>My biggest complaint about the Q is the way you set it up to involve your friends. First you need to enable guest mode from the Q app, and then manually invite all the people you want to have access, which actually sends them an <strong>email</strong> to download the app. This seems like such a convoluted process, and I doubt people will actually care to do this. Not only that, but I see no way of revoking someone’s ability to use the Q after you’ve invited them. We all know that one person who takes their music privileges a little too far, but it seems that the only recourse in that event is to turn guest mode off all together.</p>

<p>Is it work $300 right now? Probably not, no. Unless you’re a huge consumer of Play media, you’ll probably be better off with a Roku, or something like that. Even if you <strong>are</strong> a consumer of Play content, you’re probably better off with a Google TV, since after all, that does other things.</p>

    <link href="http://michaelevans.org/blog/2012/07/03/nexus-7-review/"/>
    <updated>2012-07-03T13:39:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://michaelevans.org/blog/2012/07/03/nexus-7-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So by now you&rsquo;ve probably heard about the Nexus 7. We heard it was coming <a href="/blog/2012/06/26/shots-from-outside-io-2012/">last week</a>, and now after using it for a few days, here&rsquo;s my review.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2012/07/03/nexus.jpg" width="400" height="200" title="Nexus 7" ></p>

<!-- more -->


<p></p>

<p>As a backstory, you should know that prior to recieving the Nexus 7 at Google IO, I already owned a Motorola Xoom, a Samsung Galaxy 10.1 (from IO 2011), and an HP Touchpad. Surprising as it might seem for someone with all these gadgets, I actually don&rsquo;t really <em>get</em> tablets. I have a laptop, and a smartphone, and there just really isn&rsquo;t a whole lot of use for a tablet that I&rsquo;ve found. I&rsquo;ve tried them all, including the iPad, and I just haven&rsquo;t found a way to fit it into the collection of things I use on a daily basis.</p>

<p>But, I don&rsquo;t give up trying so easily. Nor has Google it seems, because slowly but surely, Google has finally put together a combination of software and hardware that is an absolute pleasure to use. Not only that, but at $200, it&rsquo;s a steal compared to <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">other popular options</a>.</p>

<p>The best way to review the Nexus however, is by breaking it down into the two main components that it&rsquo;s comprised of: software and hardware.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>The core of the Nexus 7 is Android 4.1, codenamed &ldquo;Jelly Bean&rdquo;. Jelly Bean was not a revolutionary update like its predessesor, Ice Cream Sandwich, but an evolutionary one. It includes three main changes, as well as some small ones. The main changes were &ldquo;Project Butter&rdquo;, Google Search, and Google Now.</p>

<h4>Project Butter</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuC0i4xTyrI#t=6m15s">Project Butter</a> has probably made the most significant impact for me on the overall feel of Android. Prior to IO, my main complaint with Android was how occasionally laggy it was. However, in Jelly Bean, Google has smoothed out the experience with faster response to touch, animations, and even has the CPU ramp up faster as a response to touch events. Speaking of touch events, Google has apparently devised a way to predict where your fingers will be, and allows the system to respond more quickly as a result. The sum of these changes results in a much smoother feel to the entire operating system.</p>

<h4>Google Search</h4>

<p>Google&rsquo;s new voice search is their strike back against Siri. Powered by Google&rsquo;s Knowledge Graph, it can do a lot more than Apple&rsquo;s offering.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/2012/07/03/voice.jpg" width="375" height="200" title="Voice Search Demo" ></p>

<p>The speech-to-text seems to be significantly more accurate than Apple&rsquo;s, as well as much quicker. I imagine this is because Google has moved the speech-to-text engine onto the device, as this is another feature of the new keyboard (more on that below).</p>

<p>Instead of just listing off a whole bunch of things that I&rsquo;ve tried, here&rsquo;s a video from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHkhp6BwnGo">JLishere</a>, who has compiled 41 queries against knoweledge graph. He demonstrates the wide variety of what Knowledge Graph allows the device to respond to, like local queries, transit directions, and what seems to just be tidbits from Wikipedia.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s most interesting to me, however, is the preview of the possibile ability to access core hardware functions, like turning on and off Wifi or Bluetooth. Another interesting feature is how this new voice search seems to fit in well with another new platform feature: Google Now.</p>

<h4>Google Now</h4>

<p>Google Now is a new card based system introduced in the new version of Android. It tells you about the weather, traffic information, sports scores, and other tidbits of information you&rsquo;re likely to look up during your day. It&rsquo;s quite convenient to have information about an upcoming flight available without having to keep checking it, or traffic information regarding my daily commute delivered right to my handset or tablet. Right now the number of available &lsquo;cards&rsquo; is limited, but as the number of uses expands, the functionality will continue to grow.</p>

<h4>Other features</h4>

<p>In addition to the fancy speech-to-text features, as well as the speed improvements, Google has added rich notifications that allow you to perform actions without opening the app. You can control the music player, or reply to a SMS message, all from the notification tray. Another addition is a new keyboard, which does text prediction. If you&rsquo;ve ever used Swiftkey, you&rsquo;ll feel right at home with the new stock keyboard. Also included is the offline speech-to-text engine, which allows for speedy transcription, if you&rsquo;re into that.</p>

<p>Other changes include some fancy new camera and gallery improvements, and now Chrome is the standard browser. Combined with tab sync from other machines, this is the best mobile browsing experience I&rsquo;ve had so far.</p>

<h2>Hardware</h2>

<p>At 340 grams (compared to the Kindle Fire’s 413 grams), the Nexus 7 feels extremely light. It measures 10.45mm thick, which is just shy of the thickness of the Kindle Fire. The front of the tablet is an IPS 7-inch 1280 x 800 display, which is powered by an NVIDIA Tegra 3 quad-core processor, with 12 GPU cores, and 1GB of RAM. As for storage, it comes in 8GB ($199) and 16GB ($249) capacities.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/2012/07/03/chrome.jpg" width="375" height="200" title="Chrome" ></p>

<p>In addition to that serious computing power, the Nexus 7 has plenty of sensors and radios. Under the hood, there&rsquo;s Bluetooth and NFC, not to mention GPS, an accelerometer, a digital compass and a gyroscope. All this is paired with a battery that managed to last me around eight hours. Based on other reviews I&rsquo;ve seen, the battery seems to last between seven and nine hours, depending on usage.</p>

<p>This all sounds fantastic, but there&rsquo;s a few things that could have been added/improved as well. First, since there&rsquo;s a lack of a rear camera, no camera app has been included. This is most certainly not a deal breaker, but it&rsquo;s worth noting, if you&rsquo;re into self portraits. There&rsquo;s also no HDMI/MHL output, nor a MicroSD slot. The only other gripe that I have is that the speakers are fairly inadiquite, so you&rsquo;ll be reaching for your headphones.</p>

<p>The Nexus 7 is a great deal for a tablet that costs just under $200. It has a great display, smooth performance and all the bells and whistles of Jelly Bean. In my opinion, this is the best Android tablet available.</p>

<p>And for the first time, I&rsquo;m actually excited about using a tablet.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, if you were wondering: I did preorder Project Glass.</p>

    <updated>2012-06-05T20:08:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://michaelevans.org/blog/2012/06/05/the-raspberry-pi-has-arrived</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As the title suggests, I just received my <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a> (Model B) in the mail. For those who don&rsquo;t know about the Raspberry Pi, it&rsquo;s a small little computer with 256MB of RAM, a 700MHz CPU and a GPU capable of 1080p output over HDMI. Connectivity is provided via 2 USB 2.0 ports, and a RJ45 10/100 Ethernet port. There&rsquo;s HDMI and RCA video, and a 3.5mm jack for audio. Lastly, there&rsquo;s an SD slot on the bottom for storage, and the device is powered by a microUSB port, the same one as most smartphones.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2012/06/05/raspberrypi.jpg" width="700" height="200" title="Pi Box" ></p>

<p>I have to say, despite looking at pictures, and seeing information about the Pi on the web, I&rsquo;m still surprised how small this thing is. It&rsquo;s so small that the box that it comes in looks like a deck of playing cards:</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/2012/06/05/box.jpg" width="200" height="100" title="Pi Box" ></p>

<p>I decided to go with the <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> image, not only because I&rsquo;m familiar with it, but also because that is the suggested distro in the documentation. I&rsquo;m considering switching to Arch after I fiddle around with it a little bit more.  After quickly running to pick up an SD card, I hastily plugged in the Pi to my home network, and plugged in the power. A few seconds later, and I was up and running. I logged in and tried the default setup of LXDE (pictured below), and I have to say, it&rsquo;s a little sluggish. I tried out some of the included apps, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midori_(web_browser)">Midori</a> (the default browser), and a few of the included development tools.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/2012/06/05/it_lives.jpg" width="400" height="200" title="Pi Box" ></p>

<p>While the CPU is a little on the slow side, the GPU performance looks impressive. It plays 1080p content with no trouble, and I&rsquo;m going to try streaming some video from my NAS later. Others on the internet have reported no issues with that so far.</p>

<p>Anyway, I still haven&rsquo;t figured out what I&rsquo;m going to do with it yet, but it is a pretty fun little machine. I am investigating options for cases, since I also don&rsquo;t really have a good place for it yet. I was looking at <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/model/486999/">this one</a> on Shapeways, but then the case would cost more than the computer itself! The Raspberry Pi foundation appears to be working on something though.</p>

<h6>Small Computer, Huge Screen</h6>

<p><img src="/images/2012/06/05/lxde.jpg" width="700" height="200" title="Pi Box" ></p>

<p>Is it worth the $35? Yeah, I think so. Maybe not to the average person, since it&rsquo;s pretty underpowered for things like web browsing. The community around this thing seems huge (and probably will grow as more are shipped) which makes me feel there will be more in store for it. At this price, it&rsquo;s slightly more expensive than an <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, and a lot more versatile (at least from a software perspective).</p>
