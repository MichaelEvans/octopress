    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This morning Google put up some new details regarding Project Glass, including <a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/how-it-feels/">a video</a> showing what it's like to wear Glass, and a <a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/what-it-does/">list of things</a> that Glass can do. They are also sponsoring a new contest where anyone can <a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/how-to-get-one/">join the Glass Explorers</a> (people who will be getting the Developer Edition). I was fortunate enough to be able to attend the Glass Foundry event in New York earlier this month, and got to experience Project Glass first hand. While I cannot say too much more than what you can gather from the Google page, I do have some exciting news!</p>

<p>Me (and my team, which included Jacob Hilker and Ryan Warner), won the Glass Foundry Hackathon! Like I said, I cannot share much more about it, but I do have this sweet picture of me wearing them:</p>

<p>And the best part is the prize for the winners - a free Glass Explorer device (when they are available, of course).</p>
